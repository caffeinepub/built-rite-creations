## Summary
**Goal:** Recreate the public marketing website content and structure from https://precisionlasernw.com as a new site branded “Built Rite Creations”.

**Planned changes:**
- Rebuild all public pages/sections to match the source site’s page structure, navigation, footer links, and written content, replacing the company name everywhere with “Built Rite Creations”.
- Implement responsive, accessible layouts for mobile/tablet/desktop with working navigation and no broken links.
- Add sensible SEO defaults: per-page document titles and a global meta description.
- Apply a cohesive industrial/craftsmanship visual theme (colors, typography, spacing, component styling) consistently across the site.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can browse a fully functional, responsive “Built Rite Creations” marketing website that mirrors the source site’s content/sections, with updated branding and working navigation plus basic SEO titles/description.
