  "summary": "Diff adds a new multi-page marketing frontend (Home/Services/Gallery/About/Contact) with TanStack Router, a header/footer layout, page-level document titles, and a global meta description. However, the diff evidence does not demonstrate that the page structure/sections and written content specifically match precisionlasernw.com, and it introduces authentication/actor plumbing that is not required for a static marketing site.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Recreate a public marketing website whose page structure, sections, and written content match the current content found on https://precisionlasernw.com, but with the company name changed everywhere to \"Built Rite Creations\".",
      "reason": "The diff shows newly written generic laser-cleaning marketing copy and a 5-page structure, but provides no evidence that all pages/sections and written content match the source site (precisionlasernw.com) or that all corresponding navigation/footer links from the source are represented.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Apply a cohesive visual theme (colors, typography, spacing, and component styling) that fits a construction/woodworking/industrial craftsmanship brand for \"Built Rite Creations\" and use it consistently across the entire site (avoid default-looking template styling).",
      "reason": "There are two different `frontend/src/index.css` contents shown in the diff summary (one with an 'Industrial/Craft Color Palette' and typography scale, and another that appears to revert to a more default grayscale token set). This makes it unclear that a single cohesive industrial/craft theme is consistently applied across the site.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly scopes to a static marketing site and says only add backend functionality if required; the diff adds Internet Identity context and actor creation hooks without any marketing-site need shown.",
